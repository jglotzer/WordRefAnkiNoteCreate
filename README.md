# WordRefAnkiNoteCreate
Command line utility for creating Anki Notes using WordReference.com

As a long time user of both Anki and WordReference.com for language learning I've
always wanted to be able to automate Anki Note creation based on the content available
at WordReference.com.

Anki is a platform for creating and reviewing flash cards, often for language learning
but many other applications are possible.

WordReference.com is a site with a large number of bilingual dictionaries (French/English,
Spanish/Portugese, etc.).

Creating Notes (Notes in Anki means a "card" with two sides) in Anki can be laborious,
time consuming and error prone (like all manual activities).

The goal of this project is to automate Anki Note creation by using content from
WordReference.com.

Here are a couple of examples of Anki Notes created programmatically.
